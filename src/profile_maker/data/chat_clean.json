If you live in or near the United Kingdom, happy to say we'll be hosting the first-ever, in-person CS50x Puzzle Day in London on Friday, October 10, 2025 at 5:00 PM British Summer Time, hosted at Meta by me, Professor Daniel Wilson from Oxford, Professor Tom Crawford from Oxford (and Cambridge and Tom Rocks Maths), and CS50's alumni and friends at Meta! If unfamiliar, CS50x Puzzle Day is an opportunity to collaborate on teams of 2, 3, and 4 to solve a packet of puzzles (i.e., logic problems). Among the event's goals is to send a message that computer science is more about problem-solving than it is about, say, programming. Puzzles are not programming challenges. No prior CS or programming experience needed, just logic and smarts! No team? No problem! We will help teams form at the event. CS50x Puzzle Day at Meta in London Join us for the first-ever CS50x Puzzle Day at Meta in London!"
