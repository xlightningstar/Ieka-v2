2025-02-26 19:16 | subhanafz: it would just update it
2025-02-26 19:16 | subhanafz: but you would obviously have to run git pull still to get the latest changes

2025-03-08 23:49 | subhanafz: and u can pay to get more
2025-03-08 23:49 | subhanafz: for this im not using it i just rented a 4090 rn
2025-03-08 23:49 | subhanafz: for lik 0.69$/hr
2025-03-08 23:50 | subhanafz: quite expensive
2025-03-08 23:50 | subhanafz: why not
2025-03-08 23:50 | subhanafz: its not that much
2025-03-08 23:50 | subhanafz: since im only running it for like an hour
2025-03-08 23:50 | subhanafz: training doesnt take that long
2025-03-08 23:50 | subhanafz: i just need loads of vram
2025-03-08 23:50 | subhanafz: for a lil bit
2025-03-08 23:51 | subhanafz: maybe
2025-03-08 23:51 | subhanafz: probably
2025-03-08 23:51 | subhanafz: because vram is the main bottleneck
2025-03-08 23:51 | subhanafz: thats why people resort to using mac minis
2025-03-08 23:51 | subhanafz: literal apple products
2025-03-08 23:51 | subhanafz: for ai
2025-03-08 23:51 | subhanafz: its gotten that bad
2025-03-08 23:51 | subhanafz: lol
2025-03-08 23:52 | subhanafz: because of unified memory because of apple silicon the gpu and the cpu share the same memory and it has pretty fast bandwidth
2025-03-08 23:52 | subhanafz: so u can buy lots of ram
2025-03-08 23:52 | subhanafz: (paying apple tax)
2025-03-08 23:52 | subhanafz: but still
2025-03-08 23:52 | subhanafz: cheaper than nvidia
2025-03-08 23:52 | subhanafz: thats how greedy they are
2025-03-08 23:52 | subhanafz: yeah its integrated gpu
2025-03-08 23:53 | subhanafz: apu
2025-03-08 23:53 | subhanafz: but its veyr good
2025-03-08 23:53 | subhanafz: apus nowadays are getting extremely good
2025-03-08 23:53 | subhanafz: wdym on die ram
2025-03-08 23:53 | subhanafz: its soldered on
2025-03-08 23:53 | subhanafz: not on the die
2025-03-08 23:54 | subhanafz: i mean u can get a shit ton of memory
2025-03-08 23:54 | subhanafz: it depends
2025-03-08 23:54 | subhanafz: ppl usually buy top spec for ram for llms
2025-03-08 23:54 | subhanafz: since u need lots of ram
2025-03-08 23:54 | subhanafz: (vram)
2025-03-08 23:54 | subhanafz: yeah
2025-03-08 23:54 | subhanafz: did u not know
2025-03-08 23:55 | subhanafz: no
2025-03-08 23:55 | subhanafz: what would it even use
2025-03-08 23:55 | subhanafz: there is no other ram
2025-03-08 23:55 | subhanafz: wdym onsite
2025-03-08 23:55 | subhanafz: there is none else if u dont have a gpu
2025-03-08 23:55 | subhanafz: it cant be in the chip
2025-03-08 23:56 | subhanafz: there is cache in the chip but thats not ram
2025-03-08 23:56 | subhanafz: u cant have it inside the chip that would cost way too much
2025-03-08 23:57 | subhanafz: yeah thats if you have dedicated gpu
2025-03-08 23:57 | subhanafz: if u dont have a gpu
2025-03-08 23:57 | subhanafz: where would the ram u need be put your video shit
2025-03-08 23:58 | subhanafz: nah
2025-03-08 23:59 | subhanafz: its for any apu however apple unified memory has very fast bandwidth
2025-03-08 23:59 | subhanafz: so it runs way quicker
2025-03-09 00:00 | subhanafz: oh no why is the loss increasing a lil bit
2025-03-09 00:00 | subhanafz: nvm its going down
2025-03-09 00:00 | subhanafz: nah acc the loss is just going up and down
2025-03-09 00:00 | subhanafz: i think its pretty much there
2025-03-09 00:01 | subhanafz: every apu uses ram as vram because it has no choice lol
2025-03-09 00:02 | subhanafz: ig
2025-03-09 00:03 | subhanafz: and also the chip has optimisations
2025-03-09 00:03 | subhanafz: because usually when u want to do gpu stuff
2025-03-09 00:03 | subhanafz: it has to copy it to "vram"
2025-03-09 00:03 | subhanafz: or into the fake vram
2025-03-09 00:03 | subhanafz: but apple silicion just reads it directly
2025-03-09 00:03 | subhanafz: instead of copying
2025-03-09 01:47 | subhanafz: SUBBOT V2
2025-03-09 01:47 | subhanafz: LOL
2025-03-09 01:48 | subhanafz: @Lux do u want the ollama file for it
2025-03-09 01:48 | subhanafz: it works locally
2025-03-09 01:48 | subhanafz: i trained it on ikea
2025-03-09 01:48 | subhanafz: its based off of llama3.1:8b
2025-03-09 01:48 | subhanafz: i finetuned it
2025-03-09 01:49 | subhanafz: which is pretty much recalculating the model weights/biases
2025-03-09 01:49 | subhanafz: mine
2025-03-09 01:49 | subhanafz: i mean
2025-03-09 01:49 | subhanafz: technically its trained on others
2025-03-09 01:49 | subhanafz: since how it works is i gave it some context on what others were saying
2025-03-09 01:49 | subhanafz: before i typed
2025-03-09 01:49 | subhanafz: 5 messages or less
2025-03-09 01:50 | subhanafz: so its not completely broken
2025-03-09 01:50 | subhanafz: LOL
2025-03-09 01:51 | subhanafz: its 4gb wait
2025-03-09 01:51 | subhanafz: lemme upload it to google drive
2025-03-09 01:51 | subhanafz: this was 100% worth my $3 i used to train and like 5 hours of suffering
2025-03-09 01:52 | subhanafz: give me a few mins i have to upload it
2025-03-09 01:52 | subhanafz: wanna call?

2025-03-18 20:18 | subhanafz: >:)
2025-03-18 20:32 | subhanafz: no im doin stuff
2025-03-18 20:32 | subhanafz: first test in singleplayer
2025-03-18 20:32 | subhanafz: then once u are certain it works
2025-03-18 20:32 | subhanafz: then go into the mods.txt file
2025-03-18 20:32 | subhanafz: and paste all the modrinth SERVER mods links
2025-03-18 20:32 | subhanafz: and push
2025-03-18 20:32 | subhanafz: and it should update
2025-03-18 20:39 | subhanafz: the py file is for automation dw about that it just deletes all the mods that are in the server mod folder
2025-03-18 20:40 | subhanafz: wdym manually install
2025-03-18 20:40 | subhanafz: there is links to every single mod
2025-03-18 20:40 | subhanafz: server mod
2025-03-18 20:40 | subhanafz: so u just paste the link to the mod
2025-03-18 20:40 | subhanafz: and it will download it automatically for the correct mc version
2025-03-18 20:42 | subhanafz: yeah obviously test them first
2025-03-18 20:42 | subhanafz: u can use curseforge too usually since modrinth mods usually have curseforge mod pages too
2025-03-18 20:42 | subhanafz: but all the links must be modrinth
2025-03-18 20:42 | subhanafz: and u should check before u paste a mod in if the mod is a serverside/clientside
2025-03-18 20:43 | subhanafz: if it is clientside dont put it in but if its server side put it in
2025-03-18 20:45 | subhanafz: yes test both mods but im saying dont put clientside mods in the mods.txt file
2025-03-18 20:45 | subhanafz: because if u do it wil crash it
2025-03-18 20:45 | subhanafz: u can maybe put it in the readme all the clientside mods
2025-03-18 20:46 | subhanafz: like all the links to them
2025-03-18 20:46 | subhanafz: later on ill probably make a way to automate modpack creation
2025-03-18 20:46 | subhanafz: and crashlogs

2025-03-19 20:17 | subhanafz: rip i just forgot why i restructured everything @Lux , pretty much if you have everything in the default package (aka the root source folder without putting it in a package), you cant import stuff from them
2025-03-19 20:17 | subhanafz: so im gonna have to put the tests in the default package
2025-03-19 20:18 | subhanafz: its fine ill just put it there then lol

2025-03-19 23:02 | subhanafz: @Lux i found a bug from my unit testing
2025-03-19 23:02 | subhanafz: because of my unit testing*
2025-03-19 23:03 | subhanafz: this code looks simple however when RegionStore gets constructed multiple times it just adds it on the arraylist
2025-03-19 23:03 | subhanafz: damn
2025-03-19 23:03 | subhanafz: that would've never got picked up if it wasnt for the unit test
2025-03-19 23:03 | subhanafz: now the big problem is..
2025-03-19 23:03 | subhanafz: how do i fix it because im not sure what patricks doing lol
2025-03-19 23:04 | subhanafz: because there is gonna be some huge merge conflict

2025-08-29 20:03 | subhanafz: NO WAY
2025-08-29 20:04 | subhanafz: STRATEGEMA UPDATE BEFORE GTA6???
2025-08-29 20:07 | subhanafz: bro
2025-08-29 20:07 | subhanafz: theres disasters
2025-08-29 20:07 | subhanafz: like actually working disasters not like the stupid button
2025-08-29 20:08 | subhanafz: soldiers can go in apcs
2025-08-29 20:08 | subhanafz: new spawn modes
2025-08-29 20:08 | subhanafz: like u start with a setller *cough* *cough* civ6
2025-08-29 20:09 | subhanafz: what is that new resource
2025-08-29 20:09 | subhanafz: and population?
2025-08-29 20:09 | subhanafz: i swear population didnt exist before
2025-08-29 20:09 | subhanafz: and research
2025-08-29 20:09 | subhanafz: its like civ
2025-08-29 20:10 | subhanafz: ngl maybe the reason why the game got updated because the job market has gone to shit lmfao
2025-08-29 20:11 | subhanafz: because the last time mag said that he wasnt updating he said was because he had a job and stuff
2025-08-29 20:13 | subhanafz: mag Strategema Fourth Anniversary It's about time... Strategema is a relaxed RTS game on Roblox.
2025-08-29 20:14 | subhanafz: hmm
2025-08-29 20:14 | subhanafz: maybe it mightve been uni too
2025-08-29 20:14 | subhanafz: tbf
2025-08-29 20:14 | subhanafz: because he said this last year
2025-08-29 20:16 | subhanafz: nvm this makes so much sense
2025-08-29 20:16 | subhanafz: why it took so long
2025-08-29 20:17 | subhanafz: time to reverse engineer the game again
2025-08-29 20:17 | subhanafz: jk
2025-08-29 20:19 | subhanafz: wait
2025-08-29 20:19 | subhanafz: barracks is blocked by farms
2025-08-29 20:19 | subhanafz: was this a feature before
2025-08-29 20:19 | subhanafz: i dont remember
2025-08-29 20:19 | subhanafz: hmm
2025-08-29 20:19 | subhanafz: i wonder what that other resource is though
2025-08-29 20:20 | subhanafz: the 3rd resource
2025-08-29 20:20 | subhanafz: i am literally gonna analyse this trailer like crazy
2025-08-29 20:20 | subhanafz: this is like gta 6
2025-08-29 20:20 | subhanafz: no
2025-08-29 20:20 | subhanafz: next week thursday
2025-08-29 20:21 | subhanafz: 6 days away
2025-08-29 20:22 | subhanafz: man the suicide bombers are gonna be cool tho
2025-08-29 20:22 | subhanafz: just imagine pulling up with an apc or something
2025-08-29 20:22 | subhanafz: and destroying stuff by disembarking all of these guys
2025-08-29 20:23 | subhanafz: i hope there are stat changes too
2025-08-29 20:23 | subhanafz: would be very nice
2025-08-29 20:23 | subhanafz: i mean i think this update is gonna change everything though tbf
2025-08-29 20:23 | subhanafz: especially with that mysterious third resource
2025-08-29 20:26 | subhanafz: LETS GOOOO
2025-08-29 20:26 | subhanafz: makes sense now
2025-08-29 20:26 | subhanafz: complete rewrite
2025-08-29 20:27 | subhanafz: so im guessing he started development on 4.3 in 2024
2025-08-29 20:27 | subhanafz: probably
2025-08-29 20:27 | subhanafz: so between 2022-2024 he was not working on the game probably busy with college
2025-08-29 20:27 | subhanafz: probably
2025-08-29 20:27 | subhanafz: because im pretty sure i remember something he was saying that he was at college or smth
2025-08-29 20:27 | subhanafz: idk
2025-08-29 20:29 | subhanafz: well ig the good news is i think after 4.3 there is gonna be a lot of new changes
2025-08-29 20:29 | subhanafz: i dont really expect too much especially since he rewrote everything
2025-08-29 20:31 | subhanafz: research tree is different
2025-08-29 20:31 | subhanafz: oo
2025-08-29 20:31 | subhanafz: and now there is actual lines
2025-08-29 20:31 | subhanafz: finally
2025-08-29 20:31 | subhanafz: 3 year wait to add lines
2025-08-29 20:33 | subhanafz: is it just me
2025-08-29 20:33 | subhanafz: or that map is way more detailed
2025-08-29 20:34 | subhanafz: EditableImage | Documentation - Roblox Creator Hub Instance which allows for the runtime creation and manipulation of images.
2025-08-29 20:34 | subhanafz: i dont think there is any other way of doingit
2025-08-29 20:34 | subhanafz: wait but wouldnt that mean the maturity rating has to go up??
2025-08-29 20:34 | subhanafz: i dont think he is usingit hten
2025-08-29 20:37 | subhanafz: atleast this aint like some siege x where the performance gets worse or there is more hackers lol
2025-08-29 20:37 | subhanafz: hmmm
2025-08-29 20:37 | subhanafz: if its like civ 6
2025-08-29 20:37 | subhanafz: im gonna theorise
2025-08-29 20:38 | subhanafz: the third resource might work like gold maybe??
2025-08-29 20:38 | subhanafz: because food
2025-08-29 20:38 | subhanafz: production
2025-08-29 20:38 | subhanafz: gold
2025-08-29 20:38 | subhanafz: idk
2025-08-29 20:38 | subhanafz: it would make more sesne
2025-08-29 20:38 | subhanafz: im spamming vip general too muhc lol
2025-08-29 20:40 | subhanafz: oh yeah
2025-08-29 20:40 | subhanafz: i think thats a skin though
2025-08-29 20:40 | subhanafz: like a new skin
2025-08-29 20:41 | subhanafz: LOL
2025-08-29 20:41 | subhanafz: nonaligned villages though hmm
2025-08-29 20:41 | subhanafz: i think its turning into more like civ 6
2025-08-29 20:41 | subhanafz: maybe city states?
2025-08-29 20:41 | subhanafz: no way
2025-08-29 20:41 | subhanafz: that would be insane
2025-08-29 20:42 | subhanafz: 😭
2025-08-29 20:42 | subhanafz: rip
2025-08-29 20:42 | subhanafz: i kinda hope apcs get nerf though
2025-08-29 20:43 | subhanafz: tbf i think the meta is gonna change though 100%
2025-08-29 20:43 | subhanafz: all the good research stuff has changed
2025-08-29 21:09 | subhanafz: Honestly this gives me hope for once
2025-08-29 21:09 | subhanafz: If strategema can get updated
2025-08-29 21:09 | subhanafz: Maybe create aeronautics can get released
2025-08-29 21:09 | subhanafz: Maybe
2025-08-29 21:09 | subhanafz: Someday
2025-08-29 21:09 | subhanafz: If it ever does im instantly starting a Minecraft server
2025-08-29 21:09 | subhanafz: No doubt
2025-08-29 21:27 | subhanafz: yes
2025-08-29 21:27 | subhanafz: idk why i thought aeronautics was gonna come out before strategema updates
2025-08-29 21:27 | subhanafz: i guess i was wrong
2025-08-29 21:27 | subhanafz: 😭
2025-08-29 21:28 | subhanafz: yeah
2025-08-29 21:28 | subhanafz: especially since he might be doing consistent updates
2025-08-29 21:28 | subhanafz: im hyped
2025-08-29 21:28 | subhanafz: its like 2022 all over again
2025-08-29 21:29 | subhanafz: i dont even care if there is an update every 12 months or something
2025-08-29 21:29 | subhanafz: at least its something
2025-08-29 21:31 | subhanafz: wait
2025-08-29 21:31 | subhanafz: strategema updates before i go gym
2025-08-29 21:31 | subhanafz: crazy
